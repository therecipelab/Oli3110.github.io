                <li>vegetable oil</li>
                <li>400 g paneer</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon black mustard seeds</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon cumin seeds</li>
                <li>1 onion</li>
                <li>5 cm piece of ginger</li>
                <li>3 cloves of garlic</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon curry powder</li>
                <li>4 tablespoons double cream</li>
                <li>1 lemon</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Method</h2>

                <ol>
                <li>Start by making your filling. Blanch the spinach in a pan of boiling water for 3 to 4 minutes, or until wilted. Drain in a colander, squeeze out any excess water, then blitz in a food processor until roughly puréed. Set aside.</li>
                <li>Cut the paneer into 1.5cm cubes. Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a wide non-stick frying pan, then stir-fry the paneer for 2 to 3 minutes, or until lightly golden. Remove with a slotted spoon and set aside.</li>
                <li>Peel and thinly slice the onion, then peel and finely grate the garlic and ginger. Put to one side.</li>
                <li>Heat 2 more tablespoons of oil in the same frying pan. Add the black mustard seeds and cumin seeds and stir-fry for about 30 seconds, until they begin to become fragrant, then add the onion and fry over a low heat for about 5 to 6 minutes, or until softened. </li>
                <li>Add the grated ginger, garlic and curry powder to the pan and continue to cook for a further minute or so. Then, stir in the spinach and cook over a medium heat for another 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add the paneer and cream. Cook, stirring, for 2 to 3 minutes, or until piping hot. Squeeze in half the lemon juice, then taste and season, adding more lemon juice, if you like. Put to one side and keep warm.</li>
                <li>To make the pancakes, place the flour in a large bowl and season with sea salt. Make a well in the centre and add the eggs and half of the milk.</li>
                <li>Melt the butter in a medium non-stick frying pan (roughly 20cm). Allow to cool a little, then add to the batter along with the remaining milk. Whisk everything until smooth.</li>
                <li>Trim and finely slice the spring onions and chillies (deseeding if you like), then pick and finely chop the herb leaves. Stir it all into the batter, along with the cumin seeds and turmeric until well combined. Leave the batter to rest for at least 15 minutes.</li>
                <li>Lightly grease the frying pan with oil and place over a medium heat. Once the pan is hot, add a ladleful of batter, turning the pan so it evenly and thinly coats the base. Cook for 1 to 2 minutes, until set and lightly golden. Flip over with a spatula and cook the other side for another minute, until golden.</li>
                <li>Slip the pancake onto a warm plate and keep covered with a clean tea towel while you make the rest of the pancakes. You should have 8 in total.</li>
                <li>When you’re ready to serve, place large spoonfuls of the spinach and paneer mixture in the middle of each pancake and fold into triangles or roll up to enclose the filling.</li>
                <li>Drizzle with a little yoghurt and scatter over some chopped coriander and diced red chilli (if using). You could also serve the stack of pancakes with all the accoutrements on the table and just let everyone help themselves.</li>
