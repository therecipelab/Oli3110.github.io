            <span class="teaser_large">"A creamy, healthy and simple risotto, full of flavour. Perfect for a weeknight meal."</span>
            
            
                <ul>
                <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
                <li>1 shallot or 1/2 white onion, diced</li>
                <li>3 garlic cloves minced</li>
                <li>100 g / 1 cup button mushrooms thinly sliced</li>
                <li>100 g / 1/2 cup risotto rice</li>
                <li>Approx 500ml / 2 cups vegetable stock</li>
                <li>Optional 1/2 tbsp white wine vinegar</li>
                <li>Optional 4 tbsp nutritional yeast flakes</li>
                <li>Fresh parsley to serve</li>
                <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Method</h2>

                <ol>
                <li>Heat the olive oil in a large saute pan. Add the shallot and garlic and cook on a medium-low heat until softened.</li> 
                <li>Add the mushrooms and cook for a further minute.</li>
                <li>Stir in the risotto rice and immediately pour in the stock and vinegar (if using). Bring to a boil then reduce to a simmer for approximately 30 minutes or until all the liquid has been absorbed and the rice is cooked. Add more hot water, if necessary.</li>
                <li>Once cooked, stir in the nutritional yeast (if using), stir in a handful of chopped fresh parsley and season with salt and pepper.</li>
