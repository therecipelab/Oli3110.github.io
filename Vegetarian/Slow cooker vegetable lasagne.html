                <li>1 tbsp rapeseed oil</li>
                <li>2 chopped onions</li>
                <li>2 garlic cloves, crushed</li>
                <li>2 large (400g) courgettes, diced</li>
                <li>1 red and 1 yellow pepper, deseeded and roughly sliced</li>
                <li>1 large aubergine, sliced across length or width for maximum surface area</li>
                <li>400g can chopped tomatoes</li>
                <li>2 tbsp tomato purée</li>
                <li>2 tsp vegetable bouillon</li>
                <li>15g fresh basil, chopped plus a few leaves</li>
                <li>6 wholewheat lasagne sheets (105g)</li>
                <li>125g vegetarian buffalo mozzarella, chopped</li>

                </ul>

            <h2>Method</h2>

                <ol>
                <li>Heat the oil in a large non-stick pan and fry the onions and garlic for 5 mins, stirring frequently until softened.</li>
                <li>Tip in the courgettes, peppers and tomatoes with the tomato purée, bouillon and chopped basil.</li>
                <li>Stir well, cover and cook for 5 mins. Don't be tempted to add more liquid as plenty of moisture will come from the veg once they start cooking.</li>
                <li>Lay half the slices of aubergine in the base of the slow cooker and top with 2 sheets of lasagne. Add a third of the ratatouille mixture, then the remaining aubergine slices, 2 more lasagne sheets, then the remaining veg mix.</li>
                <li>Cover and cook on High for 2½ - 3 hours until the pasta and vegetables are tender. Turn off the machine.</li>
                <li>Scatter the mozzarella over the vegetables then cover and leave for 10 mins to settle and melt the cheese, scatter with basil and serve with a handful of rocket.</li>
                
                </ol>
