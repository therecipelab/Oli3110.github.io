                <ul>
                <li>1 pack 20 inch rice wrappers</li>
                <li>1 cucumber</li>
                <li>1 large avocado</li>
                <li>8 French radishes</li>
                <li>75 g watercress</li>
                <li>1 bunch dill, washed</li>
                <li>Salt and pepper to season</li>
                </ul>
                
            <h2>Dipping sauce</h2>
                
                <li>1 large orange, juiced</li>
                <li>25ml soy sauce</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Method</h2>

                <ol>
                <li>To make the dipping sauce place the orange juice in a pan on a low heat for 7-8 minutes so it reduces by around two thirds. Take of the heat and mix with the soy sauce. Place in a small bowl and set aside to cool.</li> 
                <li>Take the cucumber and slice into thin strips using a julienne peeler or sharp knife. Only cut the outer flesh of the cucumber discarding the more watery core. Halve and peel the avocado, remove the stone and slice lengthways in half inch slices. Slice the radishes lengthways.</li>
                <li>Fill a bowl with slightly warm water. The diameter of the bowl needs to be wider than the rice paper so that the rice paper can be fully immersed in the water. Dunk one rice paper in the bowl of water for 5 seconds. Give it a shake to get rid of excess water and lay on a clean chopping board.</li>
                <li>Near one of the edges of the paper place a handful or two of the watercress tearing any larger clumps into smaller sections as the rolls are meant to be eaten by hand.</li>
                <li>Next, place two or three slices of the avocado on top of the watercress. Then, take a few sprigs of dill and, using a pair of scissors, chop finely over the avocado and watercress and season with salt and pepper.</li>
                <li>Fold the near edge the wrapper over the contents, then fold both sides into the middle and roll up. Serve with the dipping sauce.</li>
                
                </ol>
