                <ul>
                <li>2 jalapeños, finely chopped</li>
                <li>2 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
                <li>6 cloves garlic, finely chopped</li>
                <li>1 tbsp chilli powder</li>
                <li>2 tsp cumin</li>
                <li>½ tsp cayenne</li>
                <li>500ml ketchup</li>
                <li>125ml lime juice (more if you like it tangy)</li>
                <li>1 cup dark brown sugar</li>
                <li>4 tins of jackfruit in brine</li>
                <li>1 tbsp dijon mustard</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Method</h2>

                <ol>
                <li>Fry the garlic & jalapeños in oil for a minute. Add all the spices, stir and cook until fragrant (a minute or so). Add ketchup, lime and brown sugar. Stir until all the sugar has melted. Partially cover and keep cooking on a low heat until sauce has thickened to the consistency of ketchup.</li> 
                <li>Drain and thoroughly rinse the tinned jackfruit. Use your hands to tear the strands of jackfruit from the harder core. The fruit will come apart very easily. Put the pulled jackfruit into a bowl and put the cores into another bowl.</li>
                <li>Once everything has been pulled apart use a knife to finely chop the harder cores. It doesn’t matter if these are still a bit chunky once chopped as it adds more texture to the dish.</li>
                <li>Heat oil in pan and add the pulled jackfruit. Cook until it gets a bit grey and loses some moisture. Add the dijon mustard and stir in. Add a little water if it starts to stick to the pan.</li>
                <li>Add about half the BBQ sauce (more if you want a very sticky dish) and stir in to coat. Cook until it’s almost starting to get a little crispy and sticking to the pan a little.</li>
                <li>Spoon on top of warm corn tacos and top with cos lettuce, guacamole, sour cream, a squeeze of fresh lime and a sprinkle of coriander.</li>

                <p>Enjoy!</p>
