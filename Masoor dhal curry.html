            <h2>Ingredients</h2>

                <ul>
                <li>380 g red lentils</li>
                <li>1 large onion, finely chopped</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons curry paste, such as Pataks</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon curry powder</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon chilli powder</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon caster sugar</li>
                <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon minced root ginger</li>
                <li>1 (400 g) jar passata</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Method</h2>

                <ol>
                <li>Wash the lentils in cold water until the water runs clear (this is very important or the lentils will lose texture). Put the lentils in a pot with water to cover, and simmer covered until lentils are tender (add more water if necessary).</li>
                <li>While the lentils are cooking: In a large frying pan or saucepan, caramelise the onion in vegetable oil.</li>
                <li>While the onions are cooking, combine the curry paste, curry powder, turmeric, cumin, chilli powder, salt, sugar, garlic and ginger in a mixing bowl. Mix well. When the onions are cooked, add the curry mixture to the onions and cook over a high heat stirring constantly for 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
                <li>Stir in the passata and reduce heat, allow the curry base to simmer until the lentils are ready.</li>
                <li>When the lentils are tender, drain them briefly (they should have absorbed most of the water but you don't want the curry to be too wet). Mix the curry base into the lentils and serve immediately.</li>
                </ol>
