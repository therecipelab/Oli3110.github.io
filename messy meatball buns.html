        <h1>Messy Meatball Buns</h1>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>400 g lean minced beef</li>
            <li>8 heaped teaspoons green pesto</li>
            <li>1 X 400 g tin of plum tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 x 125 g ball of mozzarella</li>
            <li>4 soft burger buns</li>
           
            
        </ul>

        <h2>Method</h2>

        
        <ol>
            <li>Use your clean hands to scrunch the minced beef with half the pesto and a pinch of sea salt and black pepper. Split into 12 pieces and, with wet hands, roll into balls.</li>
            <li> Brown the balls all over in a non-stick frying pan on a high heat with 1 tablespoon of olive oil, shaking the pan regularly.</li>
            <li>Once the balls are golden and gnarly, pour in the tomatoes, breaking them up with a wooden spoon, along with just a quarter of a tinâ€™s worth of water.</li>
            <li>Bring to the boil, slice the mozzarella and lay over the balls, pop the lid on and leave to thicken for 5 minutes on a medium heat. Meanwhile, warm your buns in a large dry non-stick frying pan or in the oven on a low heat.</li>
            <li>Split each bun and spread 1 heaped teaspoon of pesto inside. Divvy up the balls and mozzarella with a little sauce, serving the rest on the side for dunking.</li>
