                <li>2 cloves of garlic</li>
                <li>1 cm piece of ginger</li>
                <li>1 red pepper</li>
                <li>6 spring onions</li>
                <li>olive oil</li>
                <li>175 g basmati rice</li>
                <li>200 g carrots</li>
                <li>1 lime</li>
                <li>1½ tablespoons soy sauce</li>
                <li>1 large free-range egg</li>
                <li>40 g unsalted peanuts</li>
                <li>1½ tablespoons runny honey</li>

                </ul>

            <h2>Method</h2>

                <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 200°c/gas mark 6, fill a small pan with salted water and bring to the boil over a high heat.</li>
                <li>Cut the broccoli into small florets. Peel and trim the stalk, ginger and garlic, then finely slice. Remove the core and seeds from the pepper and finely slice. Trim the spring onions and roughly slice, separating the green and white parts.</li>
                <li>Toss the pepper and broccoli in 1 ½ tablespoons of oil in a small roasting tray, and season well. Roast in the hot oven for 20 minutes, or until charred.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, add the rice to the pan cook for 8 to 10 minutes, or until just tender. Drain, then spread out on a plate to cool.</li>
                <li>Peel the carrots, halve lengthways and finely slice at an angle. Squeeze the lime juice into a bowl and mix in half the soy. In another bowl, crack the egg and mix with the remaining soy.</li>
                <li>Check your veggies in the oven, drizzle over the honey and roast for 5 minutes more. Remove and put to one side.</li>
                <li>Place a large non-stick frying pan on a medium heat, scatter in the peanuts and toast, then tip onto a board.</li>
                <li>Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in the hot pan and turn the heat up to high. Add the green part of the spring onions and the rice, stir-frying until the rice is broken up and hot.</li>
                <li>Pour the egg into one side of the pan. Lightly scramble, then fold into the rice. Tip onto a plate and season.</li>
                <li>Wipe the pan with kitchen paper and return to the heat with 1 tablespoon of oil. Add the carrot and broccoli stalk and stir-fry for 2 to 3 minutes, then add the garlic, ginger and white part of the spring onions and cook for 2 more minutes before adding the roasted veggies.</li>
                <li>Add the lime mixture, toss well and add a splash of water if necessary. Taste and season to perfection.</li>
                <li>Roughly chop the toasted peanuts and sprinkle on top, serving the eggy rice on the side.</li>
                </ol>
